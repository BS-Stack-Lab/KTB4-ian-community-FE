The organization repositories were mirrored with all advertised branches and
tags. Local-only work was preserved under `archive/local/*`, and uncommitted
workspace changes were committed to `archive/worktree-20260806`. Pull requests
were intentionally not recreated because the personal repositories use direct
`main` pushes with post-push CI.
